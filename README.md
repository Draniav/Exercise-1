## About
In this repository is the solution to the 1st Exercise; its said: 
Veterinary care center specialized in Cats and Dogs attendance from Monday to Friday at 8AM - 7PM plus Saturdays at 9AM to 3PM. This establishment needs a system able to keep a clinical history of their patients, registering medical, surgery or aesthetic appointments, as well as medicine inventory management.
Considerations:

1. Patient: Must be Cats or Dogs. a clinic historic number
of 6 digits automatically. Plus, the name, breed, Owner, vaccines status, and last
date of deparasitization
2. Owner: Any patient must have a owner personal data like DNI, name, surname,cellphone and age.
3. Employees: There are 2 types of Employees - Doctors and stylists. By default, there are only two doctors from Monday to Wednesday. From Friday to Saturday, there is another doctor. Stylists by default are 2 as well, and work from Monday to Saturday until 4PM.
4. Appointments: There are 3 types of appointments - Medical, Surgery or Aesthetic.
When some of them are created it must consider some data of the Pet to be  properly recognized, status of the appointment (Not started, Finished, Canceled, Absent) and the date within hour of the appointment. The status of the appointments when it is created by default is ï¿½Not startedï¿½.
5. Medicine: Each of them has a name, presentation (Pills, syrup, pet-care), usage (Veterinarian/Human), quantity (usually in g or ml) of the medicine and stock available.
